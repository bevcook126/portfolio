            <p>I am a software engineer with a passion for joy and learning. These interests sparked during my teaching career. While in this role, I discovered that joy is a necessary ingredient for life, learning, and success. While teaching Kindergarteners and coaching other teachers, I was able to lead with empathy and resolve conflict both in and out of the classroom. When the pandemic first hit, I adapted quickly to distance learning and was frequently used as a resource to help my students as well as other teachers access technology and programs that were new to them. Iâ€™m looking to launch a career in Education Technology in a Software Engineering role. I hope to work with an innovative team working towards making the use of technology an accessible and joyful experience for teachers, students, and the average user.</p>
